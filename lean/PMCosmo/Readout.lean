# The scale-factor readout, and the matter equation of state

B1/B2 of the review ask where the scale factor `a` and the density come from.
This module makes the readout explicit as a *coarse-grained comoving cell*: a cell
of physical volume `V = a³` carrying a conserved charge `N`. The scale factor is
by definition the cube root of the cell volume (`a_cube : a³ = V`), and the density
is `N/V`, which is exactly PM-2's `Continuity.homogeneousDensity N a`.

Reusing PM-2 (`PMAction.Continuity`), the density then obeys the matter continuity
law and has `w = 0` — so the equation of state follows from the conservation of
`N` plus the volume readout, not from a separate assumption.

Still inputs: the *value* of `V` (the expansion history) and that the conserved
charge is a number (not yet an energy with its own per-particle scaling). The
readout does not derive the expansion; it fixes what `a` means.
